# Lab 07: Vanilla HTTP Server

This app is a basic HTTP server that will respond to a GET or POST request.

To install the app clone the git repository.
To run the app using nodemon type: 'nodemon server.js' on the terminal commmand line.

In the browser type: 'http://localhost:3000/cowsay?text=mooo'
This will display:

 _______
< mooo >
 -------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||

To change what the cow says change the text= keyword.
